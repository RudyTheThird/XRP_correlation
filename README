Task Title: XRP Correlation Analysis Script
Task Proposal: Create a Python script that fetches 90 days of hourly price data for XRP and all Coinbase-listed assets using CoinAPI, calculates rolling correlation coefficients and beta values against XRP, and exports results as a JSON file with the top 5 most correlated/highest beta assets.
Verification Prompt: Provide the URL to a public GitHub repository containing your Python script, including the commit hash for the final version. Additionally, paste the first 3 lines of the exported JSON file showing the top 5 correlated/highest beta assets and describe the axes and data points of the correlation stability visualization in 2-3 sentences.
Date Assigned: 12 Jan 2025 23:19
Objective:
Create a comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis tool that identifies assets with strong price relationships to XRP through correlation and beta analysis.
Task Details:
Fetch 90 days of hourly price data for XRP and Coinbase assets
Calculate rolling correlations and beta values
Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
Include data validation checks
Generate correlation stability visualizations
Export top 5 results as JSON
Completion Date:
12 Jan 2025 23:36
Evidence of Completion:
Code Repository Link: https://github.com/RudyTheThird/XRP_correlation
Documentation: Complete Python script with detailed docstrings and type hints
Results: crypto_analysis_results.json containing top correlations and betas
Screenshots/Demos: Generated correlation stability plots for each analyzed asset
Verification Notes: First 3 lines of results.json:
{
  "top_correlations": [
    {"symbol": "XLM", "correlation": 0.797, "beta": 0.464, "correlation_stability": 0.100}

The correlation stability visualizations plot time on the x-axis and correlation coefficient (-1 to 1) on the y-axis, showing how the rolling 7-day correlation between XRP and each asset evolves over the 90-day period.
Status:
Completed: Successfully analyzed all available Coinbase assets against XRP, identifying Stellar (XLM) as the most correlated asset and USDT as having the highest beta value.
Additional Assistance:
Code Sample: Full implementation available in crypto_analysis.py
Confidentiality: API key should be moved to environment variables for production use
